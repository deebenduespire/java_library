## Singly Circular Linked List

A circular singly linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are stored in the form of a node. Each node contains two sub-elements. A data part that stores the value of the element and the next part that stores the link to the next node.

The first node also known as HEAD is always used as a reference to traverse the list. The last node points to HEAD. A circular singly linked list can be visualized as a chain of nodes, where every node points to the next node. Along with this, next of the last node is linked to the head node.
