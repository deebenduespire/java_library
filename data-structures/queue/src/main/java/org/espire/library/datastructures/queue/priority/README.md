## Priority Queue

1. A priority queue is an abstract data type that behaves similarly to the normal queue except that each element has some priority,
 
    i.e., the element with the highest priority would come first in a priority queue. 
    
 2. The priority of the elements in a priority queue will determine the order in which elements are removed from the priority queue.
 
 For example, suppose we have some values like 1, 3, 4, 8, 14, 22 inserted in a priority queue with an ordering imposed on the values is from least to the greatest. Therefore, the 1 number would be having the highest priority while 22 will be having the lowest priority.
