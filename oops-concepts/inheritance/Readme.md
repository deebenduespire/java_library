##Inheritance
In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:

1. subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class
2. superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from

To inherit from a class, use the **extends** keyword.
