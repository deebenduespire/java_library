## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Dependency inversion principle is one of the principles on which most of the design patterns are build upon.
Dependency inversion talks about the coupling between the different classes or modules.
It focuses on the approach where the higher classes are not dependent on the lower classes instead depend upon the abstraction of the lower classes.
The main motto of the dependency inversion is Any higher classes should always depend upon the abstraction of the class rather than the detail.
This aims to reduce the coupling between the classes is achieved by introducing abstraction between the layer, thus doesnâ€™t care about the real implementation.
