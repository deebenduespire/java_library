## Prototype Design Pattern
An existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a prototype, In other terms itsa fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of it.

The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development. It is used when the
type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce
new objects. This pattern is used to: - avoid subclasses of an object creator in the client

You can use deep copy
You can also serialize and deserialize its nice and simple way to copy a object
