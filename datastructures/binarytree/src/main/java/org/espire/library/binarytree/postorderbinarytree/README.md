## PostOrder Traversal In Binary Tree
The post order traversal technique follows the Left Right Root policy. Here, Left Right Root means the left subtree of the root node is traversed first, then the right subtree, and finally, the root node is traversed.

The final output that we will get after postorder traversal is -

{15, 28, 25, 35, 30, 45, 55, 70, 60, 50, 40}
