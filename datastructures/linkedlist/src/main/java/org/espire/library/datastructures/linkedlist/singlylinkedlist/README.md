## Singly Linked List

1. The singly linked list is a linear data structure in which each element of the list contains a pointer which points to the next element in the list.
2. Each element in the singly linked list is called a node. 
3. Each node has two components: data and a pointer next which points to the next node in the list. The first node of the list is called as head, and the last node of the list is called a tail. The last node of the list contains a pointer to the null. Each node in the list can be accessed linearly by traversing through the list from head to tail.
