## Doubly Linked List
Doubly Linked List is a variation of the linked list. The linked list is a linear data structure which can be described as the collection of nodes. Nodes are connected through pointers. Each node contains two fields: data and pointer to the next field. The first node of the linked list is called the head, and the last node of the list is called the tail of the list.

One of the limitations of the singly linked list is that it can be traversed in only one direction that is forward. The doubly linked list has overcome this limitation by providing an additional pointer that points to the previous node. With the help of the previous pointer, the doubly linked list can be traversed in a backward direction thus making insertion and deletion operation easier to perform. 

So, a typical node in the doubly linked list consists of three fields:
1) Data represents the data value stored in the node.
2) Previous represents a pointer that points to the previous node.
3) Next represents a pointer that points to next node in the list.
